## SankakuCacher is a browser extension that provides you with rich history and download options for all images you browse on chan.sankakucomplex.com.

#### Actual filename controls..
Yeah, I know.. Should've been in in the first version probably..
Now, images downloaded with 'include date' enabled can be sorted as "name" in Windows and it will sort by date uploaded to Sankaku.

## Fun browser problems
So as it turns out Firefox & Chrome are total messes. Downloading full videos & gifs in history menu doesn't work in firefox if the file is larger than 32mb due to an extremely obscure issue where the IPC message size is limited to 32mb. Wild stuff out here.
Also, the "include character" & whatnot settings will sometimes fail a download because of some kind of character limitation that's dependent on the final total pathname of the file. it appears it can't exceed 255-260 characters /including/ the folder path, so there's no 100% consistent way from the browser to actually make sure everything's downloaded properly.. Kinda like, period actually. Some people talk about download failures of files with long names on Microsoft forums or other places and well, if you include character names & other stuff the filename becomes long. Too long for the browser. What I did was settle on a maximum of 3 character tags in a filename, but even that can still mess up depending on how many tags you select to use. To be safe you could just use the regular name & date. But honestly, even that could theoretically fail if your folder name is long enough.  

## Chrome?..

& Also I totally forgot that I stopped using Chrome like a year ago and this was originally a chrome extension. Chrome version will still be supported but Chrome was dead to me after the changes they've made in the last year and a bit.

## How to use SankakuCacher?
You'll need to download a full zip of the source code from the master branch or a release in the releases tab. (Site changes constantly, so master is your best bet)
Extract the folder somewhere on your computer.
Enable "developer mode" in the top right of Chrome's or Edge's extensions menu.
Click "Load unpacked" in the top left.
Select the SankakuCacher folder you just extracted.
And pin the extension!

## Mass Download instructions
The window where the download was started must stay open.
Enter tags just like you would the site. So for example
fav:cyrilcommando genshin_impact -animated
would download all the posts that match that tag combination.
limit is how many to download, concurrent is how many can be downloaded simultaneously at once, and offset is where to begin in the selected tags. To start at page 2, type 25. To start at page 3, type 50. every page has 25 images.
This works for restricted images too, if you're logged in.

## Firefox?..

Uhhh, good luck. Mozilla is the wokest thing this side of the mississipi, you can't install extensions that aren't verified by the Expertsâ„¢.
